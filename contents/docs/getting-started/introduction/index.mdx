Most projects struggle with establishing a source code base that meets criteria such as conciseness, scalability, testability, and maintainability, often not knowing where to start. These challenges usually stem from developers lacking sufficient experience or resources to create high-quality code. That's why **Cleanbase** was created — to overcome these obstacles and provide a comprehensive solution.

# **Introduction to CleanBase**

CleanBase is a collection of powerful packages designed to help implement a clean architecture for [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) applications. 

# **Purpose:**

 CleanBase is to provide a solid and flexible foundation for developers to build applications easily and with scalability in mind.

# Why Choose CleanBase?

## Modular Design

Cleanbase uses modular architecture to organize the source code into a independent, easily to manageable parts.

**Easy Expansion: Add or modify features with minimal or no impact on the overall system.**

**Efficient Maintenance**: Easily maintain and update each independent module.

**Code Reusability:** Independent modules can be reused in other projects, minimizing the effort required for redevelopment

> "The core layer in Clean Architecture can be seamlessly utilized across any project, demonstrating exceptional flexibility and efficiency.”

## Productivity Boost:

Basic CRUD with 5m : Cleanbase support flexible generic class to completely support basic CRUD 

General definition : Defines interface for common atribute, policy with crud action, batch operation extension, global exception.
